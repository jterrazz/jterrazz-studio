# Create a new @jterrazz project

A project is born declared: one `studio.config.ts`, the derived editor files, a Makefile answering the six gestures. How each is written (the steps, the files whole, the first `make check`) is `@jterrazz/typescript`'s [Getting started](https://github.com/jterrazz/package-typescript/blob/main/docs/start/getting-started.md), and where a test lives is `@jterrazz/test`'s [Set up a project](https://github.com/jterrazz/package-test/blob/main/docs/start/set-up-a-project.md). Follow them; this skill holds only what the estate adds.

## For a new library (package-{name})

```bash
mkdir package-{name} && cd package-{name}
git init
npm init -y
```

The identity `package.json` carries beside what Getting started writes:

```json
{
    "name": "@jterrazz/{name}",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "author": "Jean-Baptiste Terrazzoni <contact@jterrazz.com>",
    "type": "module",
    "files": ["dist"],
    "publishConfig": { "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/" },
    "repository": { "type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/jterrazz/package-{name}" }
}
```

`studio.config.ts` declares `kind: 'library'`, the platform it runs on, and `presets: [test()]`.

## For a new application ({product}-{role})

`"private": true`, no `exports` or `publishConfig`; `studio.config.ts` declares the application's kind (`api`, `cli`, `website` or `mobile`) and its platform.

**The composition root.** An application is hexagonal (`typescript: { architecture: { hexagonal: true } }` in `studio.config.ts`) and is built in one place, `src/composition/compose.ts`: `compose(config, overrides?: Partial<Ports>)` calls the constructors and returns the typed graph with its `[Symbol.asyncDispose]`. No DI container library. Only the entry and the spec runners import it:

```ts
// src/index.ts
import { compose } from './composition/compose.js';

await using app = compose();
await app.server.start(app.configuration.http);
```

The law and its why are `@jterrazz/typescript`'s [The composition root](https://github.com/jterrazz/package-typescript/blob/main/docs/concepts/the-composition-root.md); how a spec runner builds the app is `@jterrazz/test`'s [API specs](https://github.com/jterrazz/package-test/blob/main/docs/guides/api-specs.md#how-the-runner-builds-the-app).

## CI workflows

**.github/workflows/check.yaml:**

```yaml
name: Check
on:
    push:
        branches: [main]
    pull_request:
        branches: [main]
jobs:
    check:
        name: Check
        uses: jterrazz/studio-actions/.github/workflows/check.yaml@main
```

For libraries, also add **.github/workflows/publish.yaml:**

```yaml
name: Publish
on:
    release:
        types: [created]
permissions:
    contents: read
    id-token: write
jobs:
    publish:
        name: Publish
        uses: jterrazz/studio-actions/.github/workflows/publish-npm.yaml@main
```

npm's trusted publishing is configured on npmjs.com against that file name, `publish.yaml`.

## Repo structure, born structured

A new project starts with the corpus + injection layout, not just code. Do not author layout advice here; follow the **`studio-repo-structure`** skill, whose canonical page is `studio-workstation` `docs/concepts/repo-structure.md`:

- `README.md`: the vitrine (what it is, install, a pointer into `docs/`), not a manual.
- `CLAUDE.md`: the agent brief (mental model + routing table into `docs/`), a regular file; no `AGENTS.md` (the toolchain's `docs/no-agents-brief` refuses one).
- `docs/`: the manual, cut by mood into `start/`, `guides/`, `concepts/`, `reference/` and `decisions/`, with `concepts/architecture.md`, `guides/develop.md` and `guides/test.md` from day one.

## Never

- Never use pnpm or yarn
- Never skip the Makefile
- Never put business logic in `src/index.ts`: a library's only exports, an application's only composes and serves
- Never author repo-layout advice in a skill; route to `studio-repo-structure`
